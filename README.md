# Module-15-Challenge_leaflet-challenge

Created a data visualization of USGS earthquake data using HTML, Javascript, and Leaflet, as follows:

* Visited the USGS GeoJSON Feed page (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) and selected all earthquakes data from the last 7 days to visualize
* Imported and visualized the data by doing the following:
  * Using Leaflet, created a map that plots all the earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude.
  * Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color.
  * Included popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked (such as magnitude, the location and depth).
  * Created a legend to provide context
